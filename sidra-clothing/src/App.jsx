/*
 * Hash routing, because this is published as plain files inside the demo hub —
 * several directories deep, on a static host with no rewrite rules. A path
 * router there matches nothing: the app loads at /demos/sidra-clothing/ and
 * react-router answers "404 Not Found" before a single screen renders, which
 * is exactly what it did. The hash never reaches the host, so it works at any
 * depth with nothing to configure.
